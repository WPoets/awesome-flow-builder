# Awesome Flow Builder

Awesome Flow Builder is a high-performance, low-code logic engine for WordPress. Designed for developers and agencies who need to build complex custom workflows without the overhead of heavy visual builders, it uses a streamlined, shortcode-based architecture to connect apps, services, and data.

Whether you are building custom internal tools, automating multi-step data processing, or extending the Awesome Enterprise Platform, Awesome Flow Builder gives you the "logic rails" to move faster and stay organized.

You will need to update the wp-config.php file with the various defines specified in _sample-config.php_, located in the samples-index folder.

⚠️ Awesome Flow Builder is intended for technical teams and advanced WordPress users.
Initial setup requires configuration in wp-config.php.
